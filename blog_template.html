    <h2>Rethinking Google Wave</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>
    Ok this will be my last post about Wave and all things related. I've wanted to get this off my chest for awhile, so here goes. Hopefully, reading it is as interesting to you as writing it was cathartic for me.

    <h3>Part 1: A Seedling Doubt</h3>

    <p>
    I remember a chilly Spring evening at
    <a href="#">Sweeney's rooftop bar</a> in Sydney. This was at the height of Wave. The growth numbers were incredible, signups were happening faster than we could spin up capacity, and invites were filling up eBay auctions at a rate of knots.

<pre>a = { }
a = { b }
a = { &lt;anything but a&gt; }
etc.</pre>

    <p>
    We sat around the table in silence, nursing our beers. Finally, one of my colleagues broke the silence with a sheepish grin, "Maybe there is something to this Wave thing after all."
    <p>

<pre>// Given a method:
public void increment(int i);

// This call is illegal
increment(24.0);</pre>

    <h3>Technology vs. Product</h3>

    To be sure not everyone felt this way. Only a handful of us gathered to drink after work, and an even smaller number vented such frustrations.
    <p>
      The whole point of a platform like <a href="#">iOS</a> is that each app is its own silo, working and fulfilling a (sometimes stretched) metaphor to something in the real world that has been automated (In the case of an address book or calendar, the metaphor doesn't require much of a stretch). Even an app like Messages is pretty simple to describe in terms of short conversational exchanges. As such the interface design of each of these apps is really about the metaphor and not about the platform.
    <blockquote>
      Fluent's search feature ... it's truly instantaneous... I can confirm that ... Fluent's instant search is crazy, crazy fast. It's like Google Instant for your inbox.
      <p>&mdash; TechCrunch</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    What you want to be consistent across apps is the mode of interaction, not the metaphor itself. If buttons, toolbars and sliders remain the same between my Address Book and my note-taking app, then I don't have to learn new gestures or controls and the consistency of the platform pays off. But what benefit is there to making Address Book look more like Evernote? Or for Things to look more like Reminders?
    <p>
    If anything I want my apps to look different so I have a natural context switch into the task I'm interested in doing. The visual familiarity of an app is closely tied to its purpose and helps me recall what I was doing with it last.

    <div class="image-spacer">
      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/xtalk-room.png" alt="Crosstalk: a chat application"/>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
    I think the discontentment perhaps comes from the early days of Mac, where a consistent look was emphasized quite strongly (remember brushed metal?). It made somewhat more sense in that context because you could see multiple apps open at the same time, and switching between them was instant and seamless. In as constrained an environment as an iPhone or iPad, the app takes up all the room and switching is a distinct, deliberate, multiple-step operation.

    At best, the requirement for consistent look and feel is a weak argument.
