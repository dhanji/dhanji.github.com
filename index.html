      Robo Cog proudly boasts
      the hipster trifecta: good coffee surrounded by fixed-gear bicycles and vintage robot toys.
      Opened five months ago by three Thai dudes Ð House, Jet and Winny (yes, one name each, like
      Madonna) Ð in a sweet-looking cottage complete with white picket fence. Although it only seats
      20, Robo Cog is surprisingly spacious. You may have to wait for a table at peak times, but
      once
      you've secured a spot stretch out and enjoy some people-watching. Kick things off with one of
      the 15 different fresh juice combinations - we recommend the pineapple pick me up - while you
      peruse the sizeable menu.
      <blockquote>
        <span class="curly">&#8220;</span>
        If you need a bit of a jump start order the freezochino, easily one of
        the best iced coffee frappes we've had to date. The breakfast trifle is a mix-up of yoghurt,
        honey, mixed berries and toasted granola, topped with slivers of Granny Smith apple Ð an
        excellent argument for eating dessert for breaky. If your tastes run to savoury then the
        chicken
        quesadillas are a winner Ð order them with a side of the house-made Mexican salsa.
      </blockquote>
      Traditionalists are also catered for here, the eggs Benny (Benedict) is a credit to the
      classics. Robo Cog is very easy on the eye, but it's the great food and jovial service that
      will
      ensure we return, and regularly at that.
