    <h1>Languages, Verbosity and Java <time pubdate="" datetime="">10 Jan 2012</time></h1> 
    <div class="text">
     <p>I learned Java in a short summer course right after graduating from high school. Since then, I have programmed with Java off and on for nearly 12 years, most recently at Google (which I represented on several Java expert groups) and a short consulting stint at the payments startup Square. I enjoy programming in Java. I'm not one of those engineers who bemoans Java's various idiosyncrasies around the coffee machine (although I occasionally enjoy doing that). I have an unabashed love for the language and platform and all the engineering power it represents.</p> 
     <p>Java is verbose--full of seemingly unnecessary repetitions; lengthy, overwrought conventions; and general syntax excessiveness. This isn't really news; Java was conceived as a subset of C++, which itself derives from C, a language that's over 30 years old and not particularly known for being concise.</p> 
     <p>As a platform, however, Java is modern and genuinely competitive. The combination of a robust garbage collector, blazing fast virtual machine, and a battery of libraries for just about every task has made it the perfect launchpad for a plethora of products and new hosted languages. (Interestingly, Google's V8 is following a similar pattern.)</p> 
     <h3>Expressiveness</h3> 
     <p>&quot;ProducerConstructorFactoryFactory&quot; jokes notwithstanding, there is little doubt that the Java language suffers from a poor character-to-instruction ratio. I call this property &quot;expressiveness&quot;, in other words, the number of keys you must press in order to accomplish a simple task. This number is pretty large in Java. It repeatedly violates the &quot;don't repeat yourself&quot; (DRY) principle, and many of its modern features (such as Generics) feel lumbering and unwieldy, making reading and understanding source code a tedious task.</p>
