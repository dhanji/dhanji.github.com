     <p>Here is a list of things I have worked on in the past, or am currently working on. They mostly consist of open source projects except where they point to my work at Google and Fluent.</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li><a href="https://github.com/dhanji/sitebricks">Sitebricks</a> - Sitebricks is a web applications library built on top of Guice. It makes life easy for Java developers providing something akin to the simplicity of Rails or Django yet with the rigor and type safety of Java. Some of the ideas in JAX-RS mirror those found in Sitebricks. Sitebricks is in use at many startups and web companies.</li> 
      <li><a href="http://fluent.io">Fluent.io</a> - This is an email startup I founded along with some ex-colleagues from Google. It is built on Sitebricks and features an instant-search capability similar to Google Search, but over your email. I designed and built this feature from the ground up, including special adaptations to make it scale for hundreds of concurrent users with near-realtime indexing. I also created a pure-Java, custom IMAP engine using Non-blocking IO to fetch gigabytes of messages concurrently, performing over 50x better than industry standard JavaMail. Additionally, I also designed a fault-tolerant sharded messaging layer for communication over websocket and inter-process responsibilities. I am responsible for the entire tech stack at Fluent, the product is still in Beta.</li> 
     </ul> 
     <blockquote> 
      <p>Fluent's search feature ... it's truly instantaneous... I can confirm that ... Fluent's instant search is crazy, crazy fast. It's like Google Instant for your inbox.</p> 
     </blockquote> 
     <p> -- <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/31/first-impressions-on-fluent-the-startup-promising-the-future-of-email">TechCrunch</a></p> 
     <blockquote> 
      <p>The speed and accuracy of the mail search is stupendous; it makes you wonder why Google doesn't have something similar in place for its own Gmail interface.</p> 
     </blockquote> 
     <p> -- <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9227899/Fluent_review_An_innovative_new_interface_for_Gmail">Computer World</a></p> 
     <ul> 
      <li><a href="http://wave.google.com">Google Wave</a> - In my nearly two years at this project, I helped design and build the Realtime search and indexing architecture, many aspects of the GWT-based user interface, the Data and Wave embedding APIs and also spent a lot of time on scalability and performance. I intend to make a series of posts describing my experiences with Wave, Google and working on large, disruptive projects in general.</li> 
      <li>I have also represented Google on the JAX-RS, JSR-303 (Bean Validation) and Servlet expert groups. They have since withdrawn from these efforts.</li> 
      <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-guice">Guice</a> - I was the official maintainer of Guice for a long time along with Jesse Wilson. I created the Guice Servlet and Persist extensions that are widely in use at many startups and websites. Nearly every Java program at Google uses these technologies.</li> 
      <li><a href="http://looplang.org">Loop</a> - A functional programming language. Borrowing from the syntax and semantics of Scheme, Ruby, Haskell and Erlang, Loop is an attempt to create a practical, elegant and powerful programming language for quick development. For a tagline you could think of it as reinventing Lisp with modern syntactic influences.</li> 
      <li><a href="http://mvel.codehaus.org">MVEL</a> - I helped write the static typing layer for this fast, wonderful little expression language from my dear friend <a href="http://twitter.com/brockm">Mike Brock</a>. I remain a devoted fan.</li> 
      <li><a href="https://github.com/sonatype/polyglot-maven/tree/master/pmaven-atom">Maven Atom</a> - An experiment to create a concise and elegant alternative grammar for Maven. Part of the <a href="http://polyglot.sonatype.org/">Polyglot Maven</a> project. Here is an example:</li> 
     </ul> 
     <pre>   repositories &lt;&lt; &quot;http://repository.codehaus.org&quot;,
                     &quot;http://repo1.maven.org/maven2&quot;
    project &quot;Google Guice&quot; @ &quot;http://code.google.com/p/google-guice&quot;
       id: com.google.inject:guice:4.0
       srcs: [ src: &quot;src&quot; test: &quot;test&quot; ]
       deps: [ junit:junit:3.8.1 ]
       scm:  [ url: &quot;url:git:git@github.com:mikebrock/mvel.git&quot; ]</pre> 
     <p>After Wave, I also worked on a few secret projects at Google. One of these was released as the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/03/whats-new-with-blogger.html">smart content discovery</a> feature that was launched inside Blogger at SXSW 2010.</p> 
     <p>In addition, I have a number of side projects I am always working on. As they mature I will post about them on this website. see <a href="/about">about me</a> for more.</p>
