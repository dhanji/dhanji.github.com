     <p>Hi, I am Dhanji R. Prasanna, hacker-at-large. I like to <a href="http://rethrick.com/projects">build things</a>.</p> 
     <p>I formerly worked at Google where I was a member of the Wave team among other things. In my two years on the project, I mainly worked on the Realtime Search and Indexing component where I helped design one of the most complex bits of machinery in the paradigm of search. In this I was fortunate to work with some very talented engineers, from whom I have learned the world and more. While at Wave, I also worked on its APIs and its scalability, with a particular emphasis on JVM performance and garbage collection.</p> 
     <p>My background is primarily in Java. I represented Google on several Java expert groups and was a member of Google's internal leadership council on all matters Java. Before that I worked as a consultant at ThoughtWorks.</p> 
     <p>In my free time I contribute to various open source <a href="/projects">projects</a>. I created the Sitebricks web platform which sits behind many large projects including Maven Central and Repository Search. I also created and maintain Guice's Servlet request dispatching module. If you have ever used Gmail, Blogger, Google Apps, Wave or AdWords, chances are that your pageviews have been dispatched by my code.</p> 
     <p>Additionally, I am one of the authors of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_API_for_RESTful_Web_Services">JAX-RS</a> Specification for RESTful web services.</p> 
     <p>If you like books on Software Engineering you might enjoy <a href="http://manning.com/prasanna">Dependency Injection: Design Patterns</a>.</p> 
     <p>If you'd like to shout a question at me or simply say hi, I'm <a href="http://twitter.com/dhanji">on Twitter</a>. Or privately via [myfirstname] at gmail.</p>
