# Clarity and Interpretation

There has been a fair amount of attention around two of my recent articles (Waving Goodbye
 and Like It or Not, the latter even running on CNN Money). Most of the reactions I've received have
been positive, but many have been negative or downright vitriolic. I honestly didn't expect more than
 a handful of people to read these articles, so I was writing for a closed audience. It is very difficult
 to control the interpretive lens in any scenario, let alone one such as this.

Fine, I am not the keeper of consciences and truths. However, some misinterpretations were very
obviously deliberate, and used my articles as succour for their own partisan agendas. The most egregious
is probably that many blogs and online journals have decided to use my comments about Google's
 software infrastructure to villify Appengine.

Appengine is a service that I have a fondness for--it was started by a group of enthusiastic Googlers
without any executive support, aimed at helping hobbyists get interesting little apps written and has
grown into something much more robust and ambitious today.

### On Scalability

To my mind, there are two forms of scalability--development and traffic. The latter is the well-worn
and commonly understood one, to mean handling large amounts of user-load. In this sense, Google are
 past masters. The search engine handles mind-boggling numbers of requests per second, Youtube serves
billions of streams and services like Blogger continually shrug off DDoS attacks with little
 to no fuss. This is beyond question, nobody can scale like Google can scale. Period. Any cloud
 provider is always going to be playing catch-up, just because of the history of the company and the
 way it led the creation of the consumer cloud.

The criticism I laid at Google's feet, was primarily of its software and APIs.
I felt that they were not suited for rapid development. If anything, Appengine is an attempt to solve
this problem in one (albeit fairly proprietary) stroke. Appengine provides APIs that are intended to
bridge the gap between all this incredibly powerful cloud infrastructure and the average developer who
wants to run their application on the web.

To malign Appengine by using my article on Google's internal software libraries, is rather misguided
 and very obviously not a fair analysis.
