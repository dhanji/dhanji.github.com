# The Mythical Man-Month

I vividly recall my first week at Google. It was in Google's old office in Sydney, high up on the
18th floor of a triangular skyscraper. The views from virtually everywhere in the office were
breathtaking. And inside, the walls beamed the warm glow of those wonderful colors so familiar
from a childhood playing with Lego--Yellow, Red, Blue and Green.

I spent the first week imbibing everything a Noogler is given--tutorials, catered food, instructions
on how to work the coffee machine, and the general lay of the land. One part of this was project
selection--deciding what I was going to work on. This came in the form of a two-on-one meeting
with Lars & Jens Rasmussen, the famed creators of Google Maps. They were working on a new, secret
project codenamed *Walkabout*. Everyone in the office was bursting with curiosity (only a handful
of engineers actually knew what it was).

The pitch went something like this: Walkabout was a "startup inside a startup", it was an attempt
to remake Google's nimble, big-thinking, cultural roots in an isolated microcosm in Australia. We
worked in secret--even from other Sydney Googlers--had our own higher risk/reward bonus scheme, and
a reporting chain that bypassed the Sydney Site Director and layers of bureaucracy, directly
to the Decision Makers in Mountain View.

I leapt with both feet.

### Early Days

I was employee #25 of Walkabout.
