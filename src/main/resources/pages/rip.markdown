# RIP, Google Wave

Today, Google Wave is scheduled to be taken down. After weeks of being read-only, it will finally
close its doors and vanish from the domains of Google to the nether-realm of the dead pool.

For me, today is a day to remember remember all the various pieces I got to work on, and all the fantastic,
brilliant, whip-smart engineers that touched it. And whom I was privileged to work, talk and
share a drink with. 

Through my 2 years on the project I worked variously on Search, Indexing, 
APIs, the Wave Server, OSS effort, JVMs and web client. Between my friend and former colleague,
 <a href="http://tirsen.com">Jon Tirsen</a>, I think we touched nearly every part
of the stack. As messy as that sounds, it was immensely fun and rewarding, and I wouldn't have it
any other way: equal parts chaos, adrenaline, frustration, disappointment and celebration.

Many words have been written about Wave, warts, sparkles, and soul. To me it was a deeply personal
and moving experience, like none before. We tried, and failed, to make a dent in the universe.
And are now scattered to the winds.

Hopefully, someday, someone will try again.
