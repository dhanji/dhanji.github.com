# Exploring the myth of the Weekend Project

"Can you build Twitter in a weekend?"

 If you had asked me that question a few weeks ago, I'd have said yes, it's so simple--it's just a message queue
 with a user management layer. It's not even as complex to build as the canonical message queue because you don't
 really need reliable delivery (the occasional lost tweet isn't the end of the world--certainly Twitter seemed
  to think so all through 2007-8).

 Of course, I don't mean build the company Twitter with millions of users, a legal structure, employees and a looming
 presence in the social consciosness. No I mean a project that is a vague approximation of the end result that is Twitter.
 In other words not Twitter _the product_, but instead Twitter _the project_.

### Product vs Project

Put this way, it doesn't seem that far fetched. And even Twitter itself started life in a similar fashion while
Jack Dorsey was a budding young engineer at Odeo.
