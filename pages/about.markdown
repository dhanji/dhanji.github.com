# About Me

Hi, I am **Dhanji R. Prasanna**. I like to [build things](http://rethrick.com/p/projects).

I formerly worked at Google on Wave among other things. In my two
years on the project, I mainly worked on Live Search and indexing where I
helped design one of the most complex bits of machinery in the paradigm of search. I
 was fortunate to work with some very talented engineers, from whom I have learned the world and
 more. While at Wave, I also worked on its APIs and its scalability, with a
 particular emphasis on JVM performance and garbage collection.

My background is primarily in Java. I represented Google on several Java expert groups and was a
member of Google's internal leadership council on all matters Java. Before that I worked as a
consultant at ThoughtWorks.

In 2011, I founded an email startup called [Fluent](http://fluent.io) which caused a [brief splash](http://rethrick.com/p/projects).

Since then, I was Lead Architect for [Tactile](http://tactile.com), founded by ex-Salesforce.com SVP Chuck Ganapathi, designing their data synchronization platform and many aspects of Tactile's innovative [personal cloud infrastructure](http://tactile.com/technology.html) including data concurrency, version control and offline device sync. Most recently, I was head of engineering at anonymous social network Secret where I was responsible for all infrastructure, server and client teams, and a representative to Google's Customer Advisory Board for Cloud Platforms.

In my free time I contribute to various open source [projects](/p/projects).
I created Sitebricks which sits behind many large projects. I also created and maintained Guice's Servlet request dispatching module. If you have ever used Gmail, Blogger, Google Apps, Wave or AdWords, chances are that your pageviews have been dispatched by my code.

For a full resume, take a look at my [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/dhanji) profile.

Additionally, I am one of the authors of the [JAX-RS
 Specification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_API_for_RESTful_Web_Services) for RESTful Web Services.

If you like books on Software Engineering you might enjoy [Dependency Injection: Design Patterns](http://manning.com/prasanna).
