# Languages, Verbosity and Java

I learned Java in a short summer course right after graduating from high school. Since then, I have programmed with Java off and on for nearly 12 years, most recently at Google (which I represented on several Java expert groups) and a short consulting stint at the payments startup Square. I enjoy programming in Java. I'm not one of those engineers who bemoans Java's various idiosyncrasies around the coffee machine (although I occasionally enjoy doing that). I have an unabashed love for the language and platform and all the engineering power it represents.

Java is verbose--full of seemingly unnecessary repetitions; lengthy, overwrought conventions; and general syntax excessiveness. This isn't really news; Java was conceived as a subset of C++, which itself derives from C, a language that's over 30 years old and not particularly known for being concise.

As a platform, however, Java is modern and genuinely competitive. The combination of a robust garbage collector, blazing fast virtual machine, and a battery of libraries for just about every task has made it the perfect launchpad for a plethora of products and new hosted languages. (Interestingly, Google's V8 is following a similar pattern.)

### Expressiveness

"ProducerConstructorFactoryFactory" jokes notwithstanding, there is little doubt that the Java language suffers from a poor character-to-instruction ratio. I call this property "expressiveness", in other words, the number of keys you must press in order to accomplish a simple task. This number is pretty large in Java. It repeatedly violates the "don't repeat yourself" (DRY) principle, and many of its modern features (such as Generics) feel lumbering and unwieldy, making reading and understanding source code a tedious task.
