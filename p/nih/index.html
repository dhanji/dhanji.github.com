   <h2>'Not Invented Here' Syndrome</h2> 
   <div class="text">
    <p></p>    
    <p>No doubt you've come across the &quot;Not Invented Here&quot; (NIH) issue at some point. (It even has a Wikipedia entry.) You start a new job, or a new project with a different team, and the first thing you see is a whole bunch of proprietary code. What web framework do you use? Oh, it's an in-house thing. JavaScript libraries? Some JQuery, but a lot of it is hand-rolled. And what database...? You get the picture.</p> 
    <p>Most good developers have a healthy aversion to seeing something like this. It smacks of a poorly managed, undisciplined project environment, and probably a disorganized workplace in general. But is that the whole story? Not necessarily—even companies with well-established development houses, with very experienced and successful engineers, often follow this system. Take Facebook's Cassandra, for example. This is a distributed database of the like of HBase, CouchDB, or MongoDB. LinkedIn's Voldemort is a similar technology. Facebook has the Thrift message-transmission format, which is not unlike Google's Protocol Buffers, which is itself not all that different in purpose and goal from Binary XML or JSON.</p> 
    <p>Why then does this NIH attitude proliferate throughout software development companies, both new and experienced, young and old? I believe there are a couple of reasons.</p> 
    <h3>An Interesting Problem</h3> 
    <p>When you first start programming as an engineer, you're full of enthusiasm and verve. Everything you see is a problem to be solved, a mountain to be conquered. No matter that this mountain has been climbed hundreds of times by more seasoned (and often more sensible) climbers. Usually a young engineer finds some justification—the existing solutions are too complex, they're in the wrong programming language or platform, they're too slow or have security problems.</p> 
    <p>Generally these criticisms have some truth to them, but implicit is the assumption that the young programmer can do better, with limited time and resources, and with a more important goal in sight. The real reason, of course, is that the original goal is boring—most junior programmers don't get to code on the really &quot;hot&quot; stuff. They must do their time, implementing easy-but-laborious features, working their way usually from the front of the stack to the back-end, where senior stalwarts jealously guard their territories, gathered through years of careful experience.</p> 
    <p>I've fallen prey to this attitude myself, many times. Plenty of solutions worked well enough for the problem at hand. But generally, the problem itself offered very little challenge, so I invented my own challenge by trying to build a framework or an abstraction that did things maybe 10% better than the existing solution.</p>
