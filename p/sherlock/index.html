   <h2>More than a Boswell</h2> 
   <div class="text">
    <p></p>   
    <p>To say that I am a fan of Sherlock Holmes is like saying the Pope has a passing interest in Christianity. I have a deep fondness for the Victorian detective stories, and read all 4 novels and 56 short stories multiple times before I was 13. I watched with great interest, then, the two new revivals of this enormous, looming franchise: <em>Sherlock</em>, the BBC TV show and the somewhat more classical (at least in period) <em>Sherlock Holmes</em> films by Guy Ritchie. Having watched actors from Ian Richardson to Jeremy Brett play the title character, I always approach new remakes with some trepidation. I have never been a particular fan of any one portrayal of Sherlock Holmes. In some sense I believe he is a larger and more fantastical presence than any actor can reasonably portray.</p> 
    <p>I do, however, set aside my disbelief, incredulity and impossibly high expectations in an attempt to treat each new adaptation fairly and for what it is--an interpretation of the great detective and his erstwhile partner. In each turn, these adaptations equally and summarily disappoint me. They are all consistently poor, with a retelling of the story so faded and coarse that it either misses the entire tension in the plot, or makes a perfect hash of its vaunted title characters.</p> 
    <p>And this I suppose is the major complaint that I have--until now, nearly all of the film and television adaptations treat Dr. Watson poorly. He is either a hapless sidekick, pitied and suffered (as a pet might be) by his vastly superior companion--or worse, a dumb prop piece who voices the obvious questions the audience has been harboring at appropriate times to drive the plot along. In either skin, the character of Dr. Watson has been ruthlessly denigrated by his writers and performers thus far.</p> 
    <p>It was with great delight then that I watched both these two new adaptations, that not only cast first rate actors to play Dr. Watson (Martin Freeman &amp; Jude Law) but that also do him great justice as a character by oscillating his role between friend, foil, confidant, rescuer and secret lover. This last one is particularly sharp in the TV series Sherlock, which incessantly pokes fun at Watson's many failed heterosexual romances, his unconvincing denials of countless misreads by minor characters of their sexuality, and of Holmes's own ambiguous reactions on the matter. In 21st century London, it is less an item of note that Holmes and Watson often share rooms together, than that they do it for purely platonic reasons.</p> 
    <p>The film version attacks this from a somewhat less direct but equally palpable angle--with Holmes's obstinate jealousy of Watson's fiancee, often bordering on the boorish and cruel. When Holmes reluctantly agrees to meet her for dinner, then proceeds to humiliate her in front of Watson by erroneously deducing past romances, it is hard to imagine the cold, calculating consulting detective of Baker street having no passions on the matter of his best friend's engagement to a member of the opposite sex and imminent departure from their shared rooms.</p> 
    <p>But beyond this lies the character of Watson himself, something that seems to have taken over a hundred years to get right on the screen. Watson is a man driven by passions, sometimes dark, sometimes frivolous, often wistful. In <em>A Study in Scarlet</em> we find out he has seen unspoken horrors in Afghanistan and sustained a debilitating lifetime injury from a <em>Jezail</em> bullet. Watson is in the long, morbid, torporific process of wasting his life and pension away after this shattering event. He is rescued by Holmes, not in a literal sense,ï¿¼but certainly in an intellectual one. The stories of Sherlock Holmes are thus the rediscovery of Watson's curiosity in life, in London, and humanity itself. The irony is of course that this rediscovery is at the behest of investigating criminals and alongside one of the most inhuman characters ever created in literary fiction.</p> 
    <p>Indeed, in <em>A Study in Pink</em>, Sherlock reminds Anderson that he is a &quot;high functioning sociopath&quot; clearly more offended by the <em>miscategorization</em> than the mischaracterization. I find this dichotomy infinitely interesting, and believe it is at the heart of all the interaction between Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Holmes, the sociopath, when on a case is full of resolve, purpose and single-minded dedication. He cannot be stopped, and to oppose him is to write the script of one's own downfall. This much is clear across all 60 penned stories and countless, further in-the-spirit extensions.</p> 
    <p>When without a case however, the manifestations of his pathology are truly frightening. He abuses cocaine liberally, practices violin at all hours of the morning, shoots off his revolver indoors and generally is a nuisance to everyone around him (including his housekeeper, the long-suffering Mrs. Hudson).</p> 
    <p>A man locked indoors for days, baking in the fog of his own tobacco smoke and drug induced hypnosis, shooting revolvers into the walls to relieve his boredom is cause in any modern setting for an emergency call to the police, at the very minimum. (And more likely to be put away in a mental institution.)</p> 
    <p>But lets get back to Watson--the prime mover of these narratives. You may disagree with that statement, but think on it for a second. Sherlock Holmes is the title character, he is the novelty that the brings about the mechanics of these stories. He is so esoteric and so strange and fantastical, that we can only understand him through Watson's eyes. It is no accident that the weakest Sherlock Holmes story is the one told in Holmes' own voice--<em>The Adventure of the Lion's Mane</em>. It has the lens of Watson's viewpoint, but without the resonance of his character, so it feels strange and forced. (Of course the story itself is also rather banal--the central mystery being a Jellyfish bite).</p> 
    <p>I find a similar structural parallel in the story of the <em>Shawshank Redemption</em>--this on the surface--is the story of Andy Dufresne's legendary escape from prison, as a righting of the injustices done him by his wrongful conviction. However, the movie is really about Red, &quot;the only guilty man in Shawshank&quot;, who never thinks he will get out of prison, nor believes he will survive it. But finds his redemption nonetheless through his friendship with Andy.</p> 
    <p>The Watson/Holmes narrative is similarly structured--Watson is aimless after his return from war, and it is Holmes that provides him with purpose. But it is also more than that, Holmes himself is a character teetering on the edge of madness, he must constantly be reined in, have his ego stroked, given a trusted interlocutor, and really, made human. Watson is the only one who can do this--he is the only one who cares enough, and more importantly, he is the only one Holmes wants. It is instructive that even though Holmes often keeps Watson in the dark about his inner processes, and mysteries of the case that he has already unraveled (more for theatrical effect, than material purpose, let's face it), he never keeps Watson out of a case. Even the most sensitive cases involving national security (<em>The Bruce-Partington Plans</em>, <em>The Adventure of the Second Stain</em>), or prominent figures (<em>A Scandal in Bohemia</em>), Holmes easily refuses to help without Watson's presence.</p> 
    <p>Watson is much more than a Boswell, he is a partner, and an intimate.</p> 
    <p>Furthermore, Watson is a man of action. A man &quot;familiar with the fairer sex&quot;, who regularly socializes and involves himself with the knowledge of the day (of the two, one is completely unaware of the Copernican theory of the planets--I'll let you guess which one). On more than one occasion Watson has saved Holmes and his clients with urgency and quick action. This is the character in the Guy Ritchie film. I like this version of Watson. He is a foil to Sherlock Holmes in a way that no film or TV dramatization has ever done justice to--until now. Jude Law is a suitably brash, door-busting, fist-swinging hustler who has such a great passion for his friend and their adventures that he regularly skips appointments with his soon-to-be wife to burst in on Holmes, fists at the ready.</p> 
    <p>A far cry from the torporific, post-traumatic, pathetic man lost between worlds, no hope nor joy in his heart.</p> 
    <p>And this in essence is the magic of Sherlock Holmes--the growth of Dr. Watson as a character, his emergence from a painful and unremarkable past, into the life and presence of the great detective--not as a sidekick, not as the bungler who accidentally coughs up the missing clue, not even as the by-standing chronicler who gives us a post-events report of a wonderful, but unreachable story--no, rather as the friend and confidant, as the brother and colleague, the one who Holmes counts on as his backup over the sum total of bodies in Scotland Yard, as the man who brings the alien Holmes a connection to a very real and human life. And as a man through whose eyes, we see, and live, the adventure.</p>
