    <h1>Exploring the mythical weekend project <time pubdate="" datetime="">01 Feb 2012</time></h1> 
    <div class="text">
     <p></p> 
     <meta published="01 Feb 2012" /> 
     <p>Recently, I decided to give up one of my weekends and see if I could build an entire working product from scratch. If you're like me, you have a lot of ideas rattling around in your head and far too little time to realize any of them. Some seem like world-beaters, others are interesting asides that would probably delight a niche audience. Regardless, I can't shake the feeling that the world (and certainly, I) would be better off with these ideas material in reality, and perhaps more importantly--out of my head.</p> 
     <p>I'll give away the ending: I succeeded. It took me roughly 16 hours to plan, build and launch my idea to the world. And then, there was anti-climax.</p> 
     <p>But before we get into that, let me retrace my steps over a gruelling, frustrating and wholly satisfying two days.</p> 
     <h3>The Idea</h3> 
     <p>The easiest part of the whole process was the idea. Not only do I have far too many of those available, but at any given time I am also sitting on a pile of partially-built prototypes. They number in the 20s at current and were variously built at airports, hotel-lobbies, conference venues and any other time that I imagine the rest of the population spends at the beach and on other healthy activities.</p> 
     <p>If you hack on open source or your own startup ideas you know exactly what I'm talking about. Many of these projects will never see the light of day, but there is a primal, irrepressible need at the cellular level to try.</p> 
     <p>I picked the one that I've been thinking about most recently, and opened my code editor. As a lark, I decided to put this up on twitter:</p> 
     <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> 
      <p> Attempting &quot;weekend coding project&quot; Goal: working app in 2 days. Will I succeed? Will I fail miserably? Watch this spot for hourly updates!</p>@dhanji 
     </blockquote> 
     <h3>The Journey</h3> 
     <p>There was quite a spirited response, plenty of encouragement, curiosity and snark for good measure:</p> 
     <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> 
      <p> @dhanji It'll kinda work but then you'll never finish it really is what usually happens.</p> @dosinga 
     </blockquote> 
     <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> 
      <p> @dhanji hashtag please</p> @j03w 
     </blockquote> 
     <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> 
      <p> @dhanji Wats the app? Wat technologies u using?</p> @AalasiAadmi 
     </blockquote> 
     <p>I had not planned to put anything on twitter, and I certainly had not planned on anyone following me through two days of blathering on about obscure compile bugs, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_error">PEBKAC</a> errors and mostly, simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rtfm">RTFM</a> whining. This was an unexpected boost to my productivity and cheer. It turned into a game: if I ran into something frustrating I cursed and swore on twitter while my friends cheered me up or brought me back down to earth.</p> 
     <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> 
      <p> Feeling a lot slower than I normally do with this setup. Waiting for that boulder to cross the crest of the hill #weekendproject</p> @dhanji 
     </blockquote> 
     <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> 
      <p> @dhanji perhaps it's all the tweeting slowing you down :D</p> --private--
