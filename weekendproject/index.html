     <p>from scratch. If you're like me, you have a lot of ideas rattling around in your head and far too little time to realize any of them. Some seem like world-beaters, others are interesting asides that would probably delight a niche audience. Regardless, I can't shake the feeling that the world (and certainly, I) would be better off with these ideas material in reality, and perhaps more importantly--out of my head.</p> 
     <p>I'll give away the ending: I succeeded. It took me roughly 16 hours total time to plan, build and launch my idea to the world. And then, there was anti-climax. </p> 
     <p>But before we get into that, let me to retrace my steps over a gruelling, frustrating and thoroughly enjoyable two days.</p> 
     <p>The easiest part of the whole process was the idea. Not only do I have far too many of those available, but at any given time I am also sitting on a pile of partially-built prototypes. These number in the 20s at current and were variously built at airports, hotel-lobbies and conference venues and any other time that I imagine the rest of the population spends at the beach and on healthy activities.</p> 
     <p>If you hack on open source or your own startup ideas you know exactly what I'm talking about. Many of these projects will never see the light of day, but there is a primal, irrepressible need at the cellular level to try.</p> 
     <p>I picked the one that I've been thinking about most recently, and opened my code editor. As a lark, I decided to put this up on twitter:</p> 
     <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> 
      <p> Attempting &quot;weekend coding project&quot; Goal: working app in 2 days. Will I succeed? Will I fail miserably? Watch this spot for hourly updates!</p>— @dhanji 
      <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/dhanji/status/142727851114897408">3 Dec</a> 
     </blockquote> 
     <p>Of course I wasn't expecting Google or Facebook to beat down my door on Monday morning, stock certificates in hand, but I wasn't sure what I WAS expecting either. People seemed to genuinely enjoy using it.</p>
